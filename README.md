# this-is-random

User story:

As user I want to 
Randomly generate a list of events based on my location 
So that I don't have to decide

MVP:
The target audience would be people 21+ that are more spontaneous.
We are hoping to address the problem of indecisivenes.
We believe that the app can make the decision of what to do by giving random events beased on location and weather.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given the user visits the site, they are asked for input for an indoor or outdoor activity.
When the user asks for an activity location, they will be asked to select further criteria for the random event generator
When the user asks for selected criteria, they are given a limited number of random events to locations for an activity.
